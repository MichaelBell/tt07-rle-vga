# RLE video player for Tiny Tapeout

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

## Running the video player with the TT07 demo board

1. Connect QSPI and TinyVGA Pmods to your demo board
2. Use the [TT Flasher](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tinytapeout-flasher/) and program "Run Length Encoded Bad Apple Video (TT07)" to the flash (this will take a few minutes)
3. Use the [TT Commander](https://commander.tinytapeout.com/) to select the "RLE Video Player" project
4. On the Interact tab set ui_in 0 and 3 to on, leave all the other inputs off.
5. Reset the project to start the video!

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).
