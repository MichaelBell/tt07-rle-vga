## How it works

A 6bpp run length encoded image or video is read from a W25Q128JV or similar QSPI flash, and output to 640x480 VGA.

This is perfect for displaying the Bad Apple music video.

### Run Length Encoding

The encoding uses 16-bit words. Most words are a run length in the top 10 bits, and a colour in the bottom 6 bits.  A run must come to the end at the end of each row.

A row can be repeated by encoding a word `0xF800` + number of repeats at the end of a row.

A run must be at least 2 pixels, and any group of 3 consecutive runs within a row must be at least 24 pixels, otherwise the data buffer will empty.  This could definitely be improved!

Each frame is repeated once, so playback is 30Hz instead of 60Hz.  I might make that configurable.

The data is read starting at address 0.  The special word `0xFFC0` causes the player to stop and restart from address 0 at the beginning of the next frame, restarting the video.  This could also be used to display a still image.

## How to test

Create a RLE binary file (docs/scripts to do this TBD) and load onto the flash.  The pinout matches the [QSPI PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/qspi-pmod).  Connect that to the bidi pins.  Note the flash must support the h6B Fast Read Quad Output command, with 8 dummy cycles between address and data.

Connect the [Tiny VGA PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga) to the output pins.

Inputs 2-0 set the read latency for the SPI in half clock cycles, it's likely that will need to be set to 2 (set input 1 high and inputs 0 and 2 low).  This latency depends on the total round trip time through the mux and out to the flash and back.  Valid values are 0 to 4.

Run with a 25MHz clock (or ideally 25.175MHz).
